# Instruct Fine-Tuning Llama-2 for Email Response Generation
This Project outlines the process and outcomes of fine-tuning a Large Language Model Llama-2 to generate email responses based on given inputs. The primary objective of this project is to develop an instruction fine-tuning layer that enables the model to generate email responses in a format suitable for email communication.

## Methodology
The project has been divided into 4 major phases: 
- Dataset Creation: Synthetic Dataset has been created with relevant instruction-response pairs. Further the dataset is formatted according to the chat template for the Llama-2.
